### Exercise 1
We want a login where we use email as username. Login must now work with:
mdam@eal.dk and pass: 1234.

We also want to make a function called LogMeIn(username, password)
this function will echo “login OK” if I use the above username/pass and “Login
failed” if i write something else.

When i write the username and it is not a valid email I want the function
LogMeIn to return “not an E-mail” instead of returning “login failed”
